# Some notes about the assignmment:

1) The app is live at: https://so-user-questions.herokuapp.com/
2) The app is pretty much responsive - except for some UI issues which I am aware about, but didn't get the time to fix
3) After fetch requests I have saved the necessary data into localstorage so that the next time I need the data I don't need to make additional requests.
There are two keys which I add to localStorage: users and questions.
4) I implemented dark mode via adding CSS classes... I could have implemented this via React.createContext or via global state using a state management system like redux... maybe next time ;)
5) My first attempt of displaying a question with answers was to simply pass in the question url into an iframe src... this didn't work as stackoverflow doesn't allow this - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37799258/content-security-policy-directive-frame-ancestors-self?bla=34&bla2=43




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
